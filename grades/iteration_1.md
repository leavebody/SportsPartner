## Iteration 1 Evaluation - Group 4

**Evaluator: [Singh, Shirish](mailto:shirish@jhu.edu)**

### The project idea 
The proposal for the application is good and is achievable in the course of one semester.

### Features
All features align with the vision. There are some non-CRUD features. More advanced features can be added later.

### UI sketches
Excellent UI sketches. The color combination is coherent, and everything looks great.

### Use Cases
All major use cases have been captured in the UI sketches.

### Architecture
The app is feasible. However, the technology stack can change a little. SQLite can be used in Android but might want to switch the backend implementation (PostgreSQL Recommended).

Use of WebSockets for implementing chat feature. Or use a third-party library, such as Telegram, Sendbird, etc. [Recommended].

### General Remarks
- Recommended to start early on Android development [UI and Dataflow]. Refer to official Android "Hello World" tutorial: https://developer.android.com/training/basics/firstapp/index.html.
- Study about how the chat works at an abstract level: https://www.lifewire.com/how-does-chat-work-1949446
- Learn about the third-party APIs for implementing the chat mechanism.
- Look at the future iteration requirements and plan ahead of time.
