OOSE Project Overview Presentation Evaluation
---------------------------------------------
**Group 4**

**Evaluators: [Wason, Manan](mailto:mwason1@jhu.edu) and [Shirish, Singh](mailto:shirish@jhu.edu)**

### Attendance and contribution
[5 points] (Anyone missing without an advanced excuse?  Everyone doing at least some talking?)


- Everyone was present

### Overview of project
[10 points] (Clearly explained and understandable?  Got us at least a little excited about the app?)

- Simple background for the idea. Social Network for sports activity planner.
- The application icon and theme was nice.
- You have covered most of the application marketing strategies.

- Great themes and colors
- In my view, the overview was lacking, at first I couldn't tell what was the main aim of the application.

### Demo
[25 points] (Clear?  No glitches?  Good progress shown?)

- Deployed on Heroku. Application can be used in real-time.
- All features presented well!
- Live demo. No glitches. Good work!

- Demo was great! I really loved it.

### Architecture
[5 points] (Explained clearly?)

- Simple architecture with third-party APIs.
- Notifications using GCM. Response based notifications is a nice feature.

- Yes but I'd suggest going for G+ login as they provide you with a token that is refreshed every few days.
- This is better than using the UUID of the device because even if this token is compromised, they can cover their risk.


### Code review
[5 points] (Some interesting code or algorithm/architecture explained well?)

- Well planned architecture.
- Self caching mechanism for the images.

- Didn't see any explanation for any interesting algorithm they're using
- As much as I would have liked to see some code, it wasn't reviewed.

(-2 Points)

### Presentation organization
[10 points] (Presentation started promptly? Flow was smooth from speaker to speaker?  No need to huddle mid-presentation to decide what to do next?)

- Excellent!

### Talking
[15 points] (Easy to understand speech and points being made?)

- Excellent start with a lot of energy!
- Very well projected.

### Quality of slides
[15 points] (Information easily readable and well presented?)

- Great slide presentation.
- Theme based layout was elegant.

### Project comments emerging during the talk
[10 points] (Technical comments about the project itself not fitting into any of the above can go here)

- Your team has made substantial progress.
- The presentation has covered all the core aspects needed till iteration-4 and beyond. Well done!

Since I didn't get time to ask these questions after the presentation, I'll just make my points here:

1. Use hamburger return while opening new activities. 

2. Improve activity flow while creating new requests etc. You shouldn't press back after creating
