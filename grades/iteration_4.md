# Iteration 4 Evaluation - Group 4

**Evaluator: [Singh, Shirish](mailto:shirish@jhu.edu)**

### Implementation progress
[25 points] (More features working?  Improved demo running?  Good progress on non-CRUD including some integration? Project is looking to have appropriate degree of difficulty overall?)

- Significant progress since last iterations. Most of the features have been delivered.
- Good progress on non-CRUD features. All third-party APIs have been integrated and used correctly.
- Project has algorithmic and structural difficulties that have been resolved by the team.

#### Code Quality
[10 points] (Good file structure?  Good use of object-oriented design principles thus far in codebase?  Correct use of frameworks?  Are there other frameworks or tools you should be using that you are not now?)

- Code quality is good.
- The code structure is consistent with well written comments.
- Code is very well documented. This will help in the long run.

### Testing
[20 points] (A fully functioning test harness using good code methodology in terms of test setup and tear-down?)

- The test methodology has been followed for all test cases.
- The testing structure is coherent and up to mark.

#### Test coverage
[10 points] Good coverage with tests?

- Your code base is large (11k Lines of Code).
- Impressive code coverage of 84.6% (LoC) for the size of your project.
- Coverage can be improved by restructuring the code a little. But probably not worth the effort. Do it if you have time.

#### Travis
[5 points] (Travis-CI integration tests working?  Tests are at integration level?)

- Tests cover both unit level and integration level cases.
- Comprehensive tests have been written.

#### Fully automated build of your project with a README.md describing how to build it
[5 points]

- README.md provides all necessary information for building the project.

### Deployment
[5 points] (Server deployed on Heroku or AWS or other?)

- Successfully deployed on Heroku.

### Advanced Git usage
[10 points] (Still being good about regular commits, pull requests, etc?  Additionally, development primarily taking place on feature branches, no personal-named branches, good git workflow overall?)

- Git usage is good. Everything is consistent.

### Iteration submission and reporting

- All good here.

#### CHANGELOG.md updated and project boards updated, filling in goals for iterations 5 and 6
[10 points]

- Change log has been updated and the future iteration goals have been filled on project board.

### Other Remarks

- Please write tests to consider all the if-else conditions in a method.
- Android UI performance can be improved.
- Also, the UI can be changed a little to reflect user friendly layout.

**Grade: 100/100**
