# Iteration 6 Evaluation - Group 4 Sports Activity

### Presentation
(Was the presentation itself done well - was it well-organized, easy to understand, and convincing?)

You tried to be a little too fancy with screens in the presentation.  The same hold for your style of presentation -- too much complex coordination was required for the way you did it.  Still, its good that you made such a strong effort to do something different there.

You left no time for code review in your timing.

Your motivation was clear in the demo. Presentation was well organized, however, the flow can be improved. Too many transitions. Presentation lacked energy, unlike the last presentation which reflected high motivation level.

#### App demo
(Did app work well?  Did any errors arise during the demo?  How did the demo'd implementation line up with features proposed?)

There was a crash on initial opening, and there was a "no such activity" error message at one point - minor glitches.

Good use of Android Service for notifications

#### UI quality based on the demo
(Was it well-designed? Was it usable?  Did it have glitches?)

UI was extensive and well-executed. Similar to the wireframes in iteration 2. Some toasts used for debugging can be removed.

### Testing and Coverage
(Continue to write more tests for new features and keep high coverage?)

New test cases have been added in iteration-5 and iteration 6 to cover new methods, non-CRUD feaures. Coverage of 84.4% in 25k lines of backend code is great.

### Build and Deployment and git usage
(Same as previous iterations)

Deployed on Heroku. All good here.

### Non-CRUD feature
(How did it turn out?)

All extended, non-CRUD features have been implemented: Friend request, Chat, Recommender System, Push notifications for chat, moments and events, In app reminders for upcoming events Google Map selection for location.

### Iteration progress reporting
(Final CHANGELOG.md and project boards updated?)

CHANGELOG and project board has been regularly updated.

### Evaluation of project difficulty
(in terms of lines of code, conceptual difficulty, non-CRUD features, degree of completion)

Substantial non-CRUD features make the project of considerable complexity. All extended features have been implemented. Well done!

### Overall Remarks

Great work with the application!

**Grade: 98/100**
